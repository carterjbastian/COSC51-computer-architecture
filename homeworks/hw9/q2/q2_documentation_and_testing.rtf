\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 HW9 Question 2 Documentation and Testing
\b0 \
\
I used the same general re-compile, re-run, and re-direct output to q2_output.txt strategy outlined in the documentation for q1. You'll notice this is essentially the same thing I did with q1, except that I also calculated the hit and miss rates and printed those (rather than printing the line-by-line output returned by each call to the parse_mem_req function in the virtual_cache.h header file).\
\
I couldn't truly test the validity of my results, but given that I got the correct functionality in q1 (and the fact that this problem is solved using the same code), I took the fact that I got coherent, principled results to mean that my problem is working. For further explanation, see inline code comments and the "q2_response" file.}
