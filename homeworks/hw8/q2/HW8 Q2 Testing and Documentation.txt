\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 HW8 Q2 Testing and Documentation:
\b0 \
\
\ul Documentation:\ulnone \
The C program itself is fairly simple and is documented with comments in the code. It uses functions to convert the global inputs to decimal values (type int), and then uses a large case statement to evaluate the encoded date's legitimacy in the 2015 calendar.\
\
In order to test a date, you must modify the four input globals in the program.\
\
\ul Testing:\ulnone \
I tested this with a variety of valid dates (at least one for each month), invalid dates (especially edge cases like month = 00, day = 00, and days one greater than the largest date of each month), and error inputs (using invalid BCD hex values for each of the 4 input globals).\
\
I did this with the command\
> gcc -Wall -m32 -o TEST carter_bastian_q2.c\
\
All of the test cases worked appropriately.\
