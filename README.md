# Computer Architecture and Virtual Microprocessor

This repository has a backup of my class notes and examples from COSC 51 Computer Architecture. Each subdirectory in the `homeworks/` contains some exercise in digital design or microprocessor development. By the last assignment, an entire microprocessor has been built from the ground up. Specific documentation can be found in included PDF files.
